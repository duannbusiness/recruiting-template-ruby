<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

Dear Fellow Agent:

Do you need direction and focus to sell more homes? I’ll meet with you one on one to help you write a business plan that you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales.

<strong>I know how challenging it is to sell real estate.</strong> There are discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of other ways to get clients (I’ll tell you now that some are better than others).

Sticking to a consistent business plan that makes you money can be overwhelming.

My name is {{ site.data.settings.client.name }} and I’ve sold ____ of homes to date. I want to help you sell more homes.

I’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. I’m happy to offer my insight on what I would do in your situation. I’ll also share with you what we’re doing to generate leads and sales.

Once I understand how you like to run a business that’s authentic to you (referrals, prospecting, marketing, events, etc), <strong>I’ll help write a business plan tailored just for you.</strong> You’ll walk away with a plan of action and steps you can take right away to find homeowners who want to sell their homes and list with you. This will help you get the consistency and freedom we all want from our business.

You don’t need to pay a bunch of money to a real estate coach.

Why am I offering this? I’ll help you for free in return that maybe — and only if it makes sense — you’d like to learn more about working at our brokerage.

Let me be clear that is not the intent of the meeting. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you’re interested.

I also figure we’ll do business together someday, and I would like to get to know you. I enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and I love it.

<strong>I invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with me.</strong> We can meet for coffee, or if it’s more convenient, a phone call or video conference works, too.

I have a questionnaire I would like you to fill out so that when we meet, I’m prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, I’ll email it to you to complete before the meeting.

I look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business.

Sincerely,

{{site.data.settings.client.name}}
